### :bookmark: What is React-easy-analytics?

> After the cnil release about google analytics data leakage, I thought about a React alternative that would work internally (a Npm module, not Matomo or other alternatives), or it would only be necessary to wrap the app with a provider with a few parameters, then integrate a consumer.
>
> - All the identification actions are in the provider, and
> - all the actions concerning session data are in the consumer.
